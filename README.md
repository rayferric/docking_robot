# Docking Robot

🔋 A simulated example of [Open Navigation's Nav2 Docking Framework](https://github.com/open-navigation/opennav_docking) in the wild!
This project makes use of the Husarion's simulated Panther robot that was placed in a warehouse-like Gazebo environment.
The robot's objective is to safely approach and connect to a charging station marked with an AprilTag.

## Prerequisites

- 🐋 [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose)

## Getting Started

Just go ahead and run these few commands in your terminal:
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/rayferric/docking_robot.git
$ cd docking_robot
$ docker-compose up
# docker-compose -f compose.amdgpu.yaml up
# docker-compose -f compose.nvidia.yaml up
```

Once the image is built and the container boots up, you should see two windows pop up on your desktop - Gazebo and RViz.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When running the container, if none of the windows show up and you happen to see this error message:
> > Authorization required, but no authorization protocol specified
>
> ...it indicates that your Docker group does not have access to the X server
> and thus you cannot run GUI applications inside containers.
> In order to fix it, you may need to run the following command:
> ```sh
> $ xhost +local:docker
> ```

Then you can use the "2D Goal Pose" tool in RViz to make the Panther navigate to any location on the map.

To initiate the docking sequence, attach a terminal to the container and use the `DockRobot` action:
```sh
$ docker exec -it docking_robot-docking_robot-1 bash
$ source /ws/install/setup.bash
$ ros2 action send_goal /dock_robot opennav_docking_msgs/action/DockRobot "{dock_id: home_dock}"
```

The robot should start making its way to the charging station and, in the end, attach to it.

Undock with:    
```sh
$ ros2 action send_goal /undock_robot opennav_docking_msgs/action/UndockRobot "{dock_type: simple_charging_dock}"
```

> [!NOTE]
> If the performance of the simulation is low, running with a discrete GPU might help.
> For AMD devices, you can use the `compose.amdgpu.yaml` configuration:
> ```sh
> $ docker-compose -f compose.amdgpu.yaml up
> ```
